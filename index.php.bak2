<h1>MRBS - Meeting Room Booking System</h1>

This is a very, very basic page just to quickly say what MRBS is all about.

<p>

MRBS allows meeting rooms to be booked, they are separated by area (eg different buildings) and grouped within that.<p>

It would be easier to look at the  <a href=/mrbs/>demo</a> - it shows what the whole thing is about.

<p>

It should be pretty reliable at this point. All features are there, although it isn't too hot on the security side of things.
<p>

It runs on PHP and mySQL.
<p>
The best way to get the source is to use CVS - see the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=5113>CVS page</a> at sourceforge. CVS is really easy - if you haven't tried it yet then start now! If you really are that scared of CVS or don't have it yet for some reason then you can get a tarball. Check <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=5113>the released files</a> for the latest "stable" version.
<p>
<h2>History</h2>
This was originally based on <a href=http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/webcalendar/>WebCalendar (v0.9.4)</a> because it looked like a nice base for what I wanted to do. After I realised that it was completely different really I started ripping out major chunks and changing them to what I wanted. It's now totally different really - the database schema is totally different and there isn't all that much code left.<p>

<h2>Installing</h2>
If you feel like downloading it to play with then please feel free. tables.sql is a mySQL dump of the database, and you can use testdata.php3 to generate some random appointments. Look in config.inc for stuff you need to change. There's also a file called INSTALL which should help you out a bit.

<h2>Contact</h2>
If you want to comment then there's a mailing list - <a href=mailto:mrbs-general@lists.sourceforge.net>mrbs-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a> - send absolutely anything there. Go to <a href=http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mrbs-general>mrbs-general admin page</a> to sign up, or browse the archives etc. If you really must, you can send mail straight to me - <a href=mailto:daniel@pl14759.demon.co.uk>daniel@pl14759.demon.co.uk</a> - although the mailing list might be nicer.

<p>
Everything is provided by <a href=http://sourceforge.net>Sourceforge</a> - because they're nice like that.<br>
