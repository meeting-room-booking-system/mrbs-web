		MRBS Installation Instructions



REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have both MySQL and PHP (built with MySQL support) installed
(and working) for this application.  See the PHP (www.php.net) and
MySQL (www.mysql.com) pages for more info on setting up PHP/MySQL.

No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
application.

You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling.

I'm not 100% sure at this time but mySQL version 3.22, rather than 3.23 
might also be a requirement. I've had one person who cannot get mrbs to
work with 3.23, although YMMV. I'd like to hear from you if it does work
with 3.23 for you.

FILE UNPACKING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)


DATABASE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
	mysqladmin create mrbs
(This will create a database named "mrbs".)

Create the calendar tables using the supplied tables.sql file:
	mysql mrbs < tables.sql
where "mrbs" is the name of your database (mentioned above).
This will create all the needed tables.


APPLICATION SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Next, you will need to customize the file "config.inc"...

To configure your MySQL access.  Set the values for:
  - $mysql_host		The hostname that MySQL is running on
			(Use localhost if it's the same machine as
			the web server)
  - $mysql_login	The MySQL login
  - $mysql_password	The MySQL password for the above login
  - $mysql_database	The name of the MySQL database that the calendar
			tables reside in.  ("mrbs" in the example
			above.)

Specify the start and end of day in 24 hour notation.

There's also a section about Language. MRBS supports multiple languages,
which can be used at the same time, based on what the client is using. One
of the environment variables supplied to PHP is $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE,
which we use to choose a language file. You can specify the default in
config.inc. See the file called LANGUAGE for more info.

MRBS also uses your OS locale support for certain date/time strings.
There is some code that tries to figure out what locale should be used
based on your browser. Use "locale -a" on your system to find out what
locale support is installed.

OPTIONAL!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not obtain
the ".inc" files.  For example, if a user typed in the URL for the
"config.inc" file, they would be able to see your MySQL login and password,
which is not a good thing.  See your web server documentation on how to
do this.

There is an Apache .htaccess file included, but Apache might ignore it because 
of the "AllowOverride None" in your httpd.conf. Either change "AllowOverride None" 
to "AllowOverride Limit", create a new <Directory> entry with the contents of 
the .htaccess file in it, or add the contents of the .htaccess to httpd.conf 
where it says "<Files ~ "^\.ht">". And then read the Apache docs five or six 
times, until you know what you just did.
