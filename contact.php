<p>
  The preferred method of contact with the MRBS development team is the main MRBS
  mailing list, <a href="mailto:mrbs-general@lists.sourceforge.net">
    mrbs-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. You can send absolutely anything
  there - you can sign up or browse the archives from the
  <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mrbs-general">
    mailing list management page</a>. <b>Note: You will not be able to
  post to the list until you subscribe, but you can subscribe and
  disable email delivery (or choose to receive digests) if your prefer.
  This is a measure to keep the mailing list free of spam.</b>
</p>

<p>
  If you prefer, you can use the bug/support request/feature request
  trackers available on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5113">
  MRBS Sourceforge tracker page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Please do <b>not</b> contact the MRBS developers or administrators directly -
  we generally only work on MRBS in our spare time, and prefer not to receive
  personal email from users directly. Emailing one person directly rather
  than using the mailing list or trackers will also reduce your chance of getting
  a useful reply in a timely fashion.
