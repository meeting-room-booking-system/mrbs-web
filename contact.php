<p>
  The preferred method of getting support from the MRBS development team is
  via the <a href="https://github.com/meeting-room-booking-system/mrbs-code/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Please do <b>not</b> contact the MRBS developers or administrators directly -
  we generally only work on MRBS in our spare time, and prefer not to receive
  personal email from users directly. Emailing one person directly rather
  than using the issue tracker will also reduce your chance of getting
  a useful reply in a timely fashion.
