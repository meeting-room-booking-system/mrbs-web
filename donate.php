            <p class="body">If you've found MRBS useful, it'd be great if you 
              could send us a little gift. We are not really expecting to get 
              anything out of this, but if you could see your way to give us just 
              a little money then we will be your best friend forever!</p>
            <p class="body">Just go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=5113">MRBS 
              Project Member List</a> and choose developers who are accepting 
              donations (with a $ near their name) and click the link &quot;Make 
              a donation&quot;.</p>
