  <H4>MRBS Users Authentication</H4>
=========================

Principles
==========

User interface
--------------

MRBS pages can be accessed and used, depending on the user's access level.

There are three levels of access in MRBS:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 0 - Unknown user
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 1 - Authenticated user
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 2 - Administrator

Level 0 users can view most pages, but cannot make any change.

Level 1 users can make bookings, and can change their own bookings.
Level 2 users - The administrators - are allowed to modify other people's
bookings. Administrators also have the ability to add and remove rooms and
areas.

Before accessing a restricted page, MRBS prompts the user for a name and
password. Then it connects to an authentication server, which is responsible
for deciding if the user/password pair is valid. If it is, MRBS then checks if
the name is in its list of administrators. Finally MRBS grants access to the
page at the right level. The name and password are recorded for the duration of
the session, and won't be asked for again.

Configuration
-------------

MRBS authentication configuration is done in file config.inc.php.

This file contains a section for authentication parameters, where several
choices must be made:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The session management scheme. (How to prompt for a user/password,
 &nbsp; &nbsp;and how keep track of it)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The authentication method. (What kind of server will verify the
 &nbsp; &nbsp;user/password validity)
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The list of administrators.

There are several alternative authentication methods. They differ by the type
of authentication server they can connect to, and by the kind of program used
for communicating with that server. Each method is implemented in a pluggable
module. There are two general categories:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Internal PHP modules, which connect directly to an authentication
 &nbsp; &nbsp;server. These modules may require additional parameter settings in
 &nbsp; &nbsp;config.inc.php.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- External programs, that do the same after being invoked by the
 &nbsp; &nbsp;special "ext" PHP authentication module.

Internal PHP modules support the following kinds of authentication servers:
LDAP servers; POP3 email servers; IMAP email servers; NIS servers ; NW servers.
In addition, three special internal modules support a local list of users for 
one; a local list of users stored in databse for tthe second; and 
authenticating anybody for the other.

External programs support: NT Domain controllers; Netware servers; PAM servers.

Which authentication scheme to choose
=====================================

The right choice for you depends on where your users are:

If they're all in a closed organization (A private company; a university; etc),
then this organization probably already has its own authentication service.
MRBS can connect to several kinds of services, like LDAP servers; NT domain
controllers; Netware servers; pop3 or imap mail servers; etc.

How to configure authentication
===============================

Users
-----

You don't configure users in MRBS. Users (and their password) are configured in
an external authentication server.

Exceptions:

- The "config" authentication is managed by MRBS, using a list of names and
passwords in config.inc.php. This is done by specifying: $auth["user"][
"username1"] = "password1"; $auth["user"]["username2"] = "password2";
etc
- The "db" authentication is managed by MRBS, using a list of names and
passwords stored in mrbs database.

Administrators
--------------

Prerequisite: Administrators are also users. They must have a valid user name
and password in the selected authentication server.

Administrators are defined in config.inc.php. This is done by specifying:
$auth["admin"][] = "username1";

$auth["admin"][] = "username2";
etc

You can have as many administrators as you want in this list.

The default MRBS configuration uses PHP sessions, and a user list in
config.inc.php for authentication. It defines three demo users 'alice' 'bob'
and 'administrator'. The 'administrator' user is also in the administrators
list by default. You will almost surely want to change these.

If IP authentication is used, for "username" use the IP address.

In this case, make sure to define the local host (127.0.0.1) as an
administrator. This allows to conveniently administer the reservation system
locally on the server.

Session type
------------

Choose one type in the list above, and set the $auth["session"] parameter in
config.inc.php. Example:

$auth["session"] = "php";

Authentication type
-------------------

Choose the internal authentication module you want.

Internal PHP modules
--------------------

If it's an internal PHP module, set the $auth["type"] parameter in
confing.inc.php. Example:

$auth["type"] = "pop3";

Then set the type-specific parameters in config.inc.php. See details in the
authentication descriptions below.

External programs
-----------------

If you want to use an external authentication program, set $auth["type"] =
"ext"; and set the additional parameters:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The name of the selected program in $auth["prog"].
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't forget to prefix it with "./" under Unix and ensure that the
 &nbsp; &nbsp;program is executable by the "user" that the webserver runs as.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Example:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;$auth["prog"] = "./smb_auth";

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The arguments to pass to the above program in $auth["params"].

 &nbsp; &nbsp;$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";
 &nbsp; &nbsp;At runtime "#USERNAME#" and "#PASSWORD#" will get replaced with the username
 &nbsp; &nbsp;and password that the user entered to login. The string can contain other
 &nbsp; &nbsp;arguments in addition to the above two.

Internal PHP Authentication Modules Configuration
=================================================

Config Authentication
---------------------

Config Authentication uses no external server. It uses a list of users
config.inc.php. Configure it as follows:

$auth["type"] = "config";

Then add the list of users:

$auth["user"]["username1"] = "password1";

$auth["user"]["username2"] = "password2";
etc

Note: If the password contains the characters \ or $, then it's necessary to
prefix them with a \. For example for password pa$$word, use the string =
"pa\$\$word".

Finally put at least one of the users in the administrator's list.

$auth["admin"][] = "username2";

etc


DB Authentication
-------------------

Authentication method, usable on the Internet.

 Works only with Mysql, will be implemented for Postgresql in an upcoming
 release.

 It works by storing the list of users in a new table called mrbs_users in
 the mrbs database.

 The authentication is done by the new module auth_db.inc.
 Enable it by setting $auth["type"]="db" in config.inc.php.
 This works only with session_php.inc or session_cookie.inc.

 Note: The names of administrators are still defined as usual by the
 $auth["admin"][] list in config.inc.php.

 The list of users is displayed by clicking on the new "User list" link in
 the logon box in the top banner.
 This list is managed by module edit_users.php.
 Administrators have the right to edit every entry, and add or remove users.
 Simple users only have the right to edit their own entry.

 The first time it is accessed, the mrbs_users table is automatically
 created.

 *** WARNING ***

 Whoever is doing the initial edition is assumed to have administrator
 rights AND MRBS USE "administrator" username. BE CAREFUL TO HAVE THIS
 ADMINISTRATOR DEFINED IN CONFIG.INC.PHP, OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE ALLOWED
 TO ENTER THE FIRST ADMINISTRATOR BELOW. After this step, you can remove
 the 'administrator' in config.inc.php.
 *** END OF WARNING ***

 The first user he creates MUST be an administrator, already defined in
 config.inc.php. Note: There are two predefined ones, called "administrator"
 and "127.0.0.1".
 Once this initial user/administrator is defined, it's necessary to log on
 using its name to create more users.
 
 Experimental:

 It's possible, and very simple, to add new application-specific fields in
 the mrbs_users table.
 No change is needed in edit_users.php editor code.
 Edit_users.php will automatically detect the new fields and add columns for
 them.
 The new fields can either be added beforehand in the code that creates the
 table in the beginning of edit_users.php (See comments there);
 Or they can be added afterwards using mysql.exe or phpMyAdmin, or the
 equivalent for other databases. Note: The first three fields (id, name,
 password) must not be tampered with. All others are modifiable at will.
 
 Important: does not work with PosgreSql.
 
 Future improvements
 - Manage the user rights (user/admin) in the mrbs_users table too.
 - Have a second level of administrators (level 3 users), with only such
 level 3 users allowed to edit the user database. This would be similar to
 all other authentications in mrbs, which delegate the user accounts
 management to an external authority.


POP3 Authentication
-------------------

MRBS has POP3 Authentication support. &nbsp;This method will first try to
authenticate using APOP, and fall back to standard USER/PASS if that
fails. &nbsp;This can be used by setting config.inc.php as follows:

$auth["type"] = "pop3";

Also you will need to change the section:

# 'auth_pop3' configuration settings

# Where is the POP3 server
$pop3_host = "pop3-server-name";
# The POP3 server port
$pop3_port = "110";

You will almost certainly not need to change the POP3 port number.

This method supports authentication against multiple servers using
the syntax below:

Multiple servers all using the same port:
# 'auth_pop3' configuration settings
# Where is the POP3 server
$pop3_host[] = "localhost";
$pop3_host[] = "myisp.co.uk";
# The POP3 server port
$pop3_port = "110";

Multiple servers with the option of different ports for each server:
# 'auth_pop3' configuration settings
# Where is the POP3 server
$pop3_host[] = "localhost";
$pop3_host[] = "myisp.co.uk";
# The POP3 server ports in the same order as the hosts
$pop3_port[] = "110";
$pop3_port[] = "110";

Note: if you use the later configuration then an equal number of hosts
and ports must be specified or authentication will fail.


IMAP Authentication
--------------------

Very similar in principle to the pop3 authentication.

MRBS has IMAP Authentication support. This can be used by setting
config.inc.php as follows:

$auth["type"] = "imap";

Also you will need to change the section:

# 'auth_imap' configuration settings

# Where is the IMAP server
$imap_host = "imap-server-name";
# The IMAP server port
$imap_port = "143";

You will almost certainly not need to change the IMAP port number.

This method supports authentication against multiple servers using
the syntax below. &nbsp;It will try all the servers until a match is found
or it fails to authenticate the user.

Multiple servers all using the same port:
# 'auth_imap' configuration settings
# Where is the IMAP server
$imap_host[] = "localhost";
$imap_host[] = "myisp.co.uk";
# The IMAP server port
$imap_port = "143";

Multiple servers with the option of different ports for each server:
# 'auth_imap' configuration settings
# Where is the IMAP server
$imap_host[] = "localhost";
$imap_host[] = "myisp.co.uk";
# The IMAP server ports in the same order as the hosts
$imap_port[] = "143";
$imap_port[] = "143";

Note: if you use the later configuration then an equal number of hosts
and ports must be specified or authentication will fail.


LDAP Authentication
-------------------

There are three methods for doing LDAP authentication currently, the preferable
method uses the LDAP functionality built into PHP.

To enable this change the "$auth[type]" to "ldap" and check the the
"$ldap_host" and "$ldap_base_dn" entries are correct in config.inc.php.

The program will check the username and password pair with all the
"$ldap_base_dn" entrys until one matches.

e.g.

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION

$auth["type"] = "ldap";

# The LDAP server is local

$ldap_host = "localhost";

# First search in the "People" then "Administrators" dn.

$ldap_base_dn[] = "ou=People, o=myCompany, c=US";
$ldap_base_dn[] = "ou=Administrators, o=myCompany, c=US";

Note: There are two other alternative LDAP authentication methods, based on
external programs, and described further down. This one is the recommended on
though.

NIS Authentication
------------------

$auth["type"] = "nis";

Details?

NT Authentication
-----------------

MRBS has Microsoft Windows NT/IIS authentication support. This can be used by
setting config.inc.php as follows:

$auth["session"] = "nt";

$auth["type"] = "none";

Note that technically NT authentication is actually an MRBS session scheme. We
put it in this list as it is related with authentication anyway.

To add an admin, just add his user's Windows user account like this:

$auth["admin"][] = "nt_username";

Also this scheme is fairly simple (it relies on IIS determining a user's
Windows user account identity, before allowing the user to establish a network
connection with the server) there are some requirements for it to work (these
notes are based on IIS 5.0):

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- You have to configure you mrbs directory (at least) to use either
 &nbsp; &nbsp;'Basic Authentication' or 'Integrated Windows Authentication' (formerly
 &nbsp; &nbsp;called NTLM or Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication).

To enable a WWW authentication method in IIS:

In the Internet Information Services snap-in, select your site, but preferably
only mrbs directory, and open its property sheets. Select the Directory
Security property sheet. Under Anonymous Access and Authentication Control,
click Edit. In the Authentication Methods dialog box, select one or more
appropriate methods.

The simplest way is to use 'Integrated Windows Authentication' because unlike
'Basic authentication', it does not prompt users for a user name and password.
The current Windows user information on the client computer is used for the
'integrated Windows authentication'. It is also a more secure form of
authentication because the user name and password are not sent across the
network.

But if you really want your users to enter their domain username/password, you
have to select 'Basic Authentication'. The advantage of Basic authentication is
that it is part of the HTTP specification, and is supported by most browsers.
So, theoretically, you can log in with a valid domain username/password with a
non-Microsoft browser, but frankly I did not tested it. The disadvantage is
that 'Basic authentication' transmit passwords in an unencrypted form.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- To use 'Integrated Windows Authentication', you HAVE TO use the
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft browser too. Currently, only Internet Explorer, version 2.0 and
 &nbsp; &nbsp;later, supports this.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The 'Anonymous access' must be disabled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- If you enable both Basic and Integrated authentication, Integrated
 &nbsp; &nbsp;authentication takes precedence over Basic authentication.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- 'Integrated Windows authentication' does not work over HTTP Proxy
 &nbsp; &nbsp;connections or other firewall applications. So this scheme is more suitable
 &nbsp; &nbsp;for an Intranet, but 'Basic Authentication' should work (not tested).

All this was tested against IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000 server and Windows 2000
workstations using Internet Explorer 6.0, but this should work from IIS 4.0.

OMNI Authentication
--------------------

OMNI Authentication using Omnicron OmniHTTPd web server security features.
Very similar in principle to NT authentication.

$auth["session"] = "omni";

$auth["type"] = "none";

Note that technically Omni authentication is actually an MRBS session scheme.
We put it in this list as it is related with authentication anyway.

External Authentication Programs Configuration
==============================================

Perl password list
------------------

"badpw.pl" is a short piece of Perl, which can quickly be used to demonstrate
how the "ext" authentication provider works.

It has usernames and passwords hard coded. I don't expect anyone to use this in
a production environment - it's just to demonstrate.

In the config.inc.php file authentication section, set:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION

$auth["type"] = "ext";
$auth["prog"] = "./badpw.pl";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

NOTE: The last line are parameters that will get passed to the 'badpw.pl'
script. At runtime "#USERNAME#" and "#PASSWORD" will get replaced with the
username and password that the user entered to login.

NOTE: Under Unix, make sure badpw.pl has execution rights: 'chmod +x badpw.pl'

Once you have changed this then look at the /mrbs/ page through your browser.
When you click one of the (+) buttons, you will be asked for a username and
password. Check badpw.pl for the valid combinations.

To try out an "admin" user, add an appropriate username to the section that
says:

$auth["admin"][] = "....";

Crypted password authentication
-------------------------------

crypt_passwd.pl is like the badpw.pl method above but uses a file containing
usernames and their crypted passwords

config.inc.php should be changed to have a section that reads something like:

$auth["type"] = "ext";

$auth["prog"] = "../crypt_passwd.pl";
$auth["params"] = "/etc/httpd/mrbs_passwd #USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

As you can see the crypt_passwd.pl script takes 3 parameters.

The first parameter is the filename of the password file.
It must be readable by the user which PHP is running as, which is usually the
user the web server is running as. The password file must consist of pairs of
username and crypted password, seperated by a colon. See crypt_passwd.example
for an example password file.

NOTE: Under Unix, make sure crypt_passwd.pl has execution rights: 'chmod +x
crypt_passwd.pl'

SMB Authentication
------------------

Here are instructions gathered from several users for using SMB authentication:

Included is the source (smb_auth.c). This is a very simple program, that
returns "true" if the username/password are valid and "false" otherwise.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO INSTALL

- Download the PAM library from

<A HREF="http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/">http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/</a> (current one is 1.1.7)
or type:

$ wget <A HREF="http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/pam_smb-1.1.7.tar.gz">http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.samba.org/pam_smb/pam_smb-1.1.7.tar.gz</a>

- $ tar -xvzf pam_smb-1.1.7.tar.gz

or gtar -xvzf pam_smb-1.1.7.tar.gz

- $ cd pam_smb

- $ ./configure

[or if you want to disable encrypted passwords you can run
$ ./configure --disable-encrypt-pass
]

- $ make

[ or maybe on Solaris
$ gmake ]

You can ignore any errors/warnings after the line

make[1]: Leaving directory `...../pam_smb/smbval'
any problems before this need to be fixed as smbvalid.a needs to be created.

- copy smb_auth.c that come with the MRBS package in /pam_smb/ directory:
$ cp /<wherever>/smb_auth.c .

- $ gcc -o smb_auth smb_auth.c smbval/smbvalid.a

[ or on Solaris :
$ gcc -o smb_auth smb_auth.c smbval/smbvalid.a -lsocket -lnsl
The extra libraries (-lsocket -lnsl) are not mentioned in the documentation but
this might just be a Solaris thing ]

This creates a binary that does not rely on anything in the pam_smb release. So
this can be deleted after you have copied smb_auth to another location.

- [ $ strip smb_auth ] (shrink the file, optional)

- Now move/copy smb_auth to somewhere that the web server can access it and
specify the path in config.inc.php. For example : $ cp smb_auth /usr/bin
and verify smb_auth has enough execute rights.

USAGE: smb_auth [username] [password] [server] [backup] [domain]

You can bypass domain if you specify username like [domain/username]

returns 0 on success

returns 1 on failure

- Then set config.inc.php as follows:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION

$auth["type"] = "ext";
$auth["prog"] = "/usr/bin/smb_auth";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD# SERVER BACKUP DOMAIN";

The [params] are:

* #USERNAME# is replaced by the actual username presented
* #PASSWORD# is replaced by the user's password
* Primary Server used for password validation
* Secondary server used for password validation
* NT domain under which the user is registered

Netware Authentication
----------------------

This is only going to work on Linux.

There's a program called "nwauth" which is included with ncpfs. To use it
you'll need to have IPX support compiled in your kernel. There might be other
requirements as well - see the stuff that comes with ncpfs.

You can get it from <A HREF="ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/">ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/</a>

I've only tested this with ncpfs-2.2.0.18

Please see README.nwauth for more information on Netware authentication.

LDAP Authentication
-------------------

The preferred LDAP authentication method uses the internal PHP module described
above. Two alternatives are available though:

The second LDAP authentication method uses a very small Perl program
ldap_auth.pl. It requires the Net::LDAP module be installed and working.
For me this simply meant doing:

perl -MCPAN -e"install Net::LDAP"

The script simply attemps to bind to a server using a supplied dn and password.
It expects the full thing to be passed in - eg

cn=root, o=University of Michigan, c=us

In my case, I can pass just the cn and it works. My config.inc.php settings
are:

# Authentication settings - read AUTHENTICATION

$auth["type"] = "ext";
$auth["prog"] = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/auth_ldap.pl";
$auth["params"] = "LDAPSERVER cn=#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

NOTE: Under Unix, make sure auth_ldap.pl has execution rights: 'chmod +x
auth_ldap.pl'

The third also uses a perl script that simply calls ldapsearch.

You will need specify the path to ldapsearch in auth_ldapsearch.pl
You might try this as a last resort if your site has an unusual
LDAP configuration. NOTE, the script disallows any usernames which
contain uppercase or space characters in them, for the reason behind
this please see the script its self.

$auth["realm"] = "MRBS";

$auth["type"] = "ext";
$auth["prog"] = "/home/httpd/html/mrbs/auth_ldapsearch.pl";
$auth["params"] = "LDAPSERVER cn=#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";
$auth["params"] = "YourServer \"Your search root\" \"#USERNAME#\"
\"#PASSWORD#\"";

NOTE: Under Unix, make sure auth_ldapsearch.pl has execution rights: 'chmod +x
auth_ldapsearch.pl'

PAM Authentification
--------------------

In case your Unix system uses PAM (especially Linux, but also SUN Solaris)
you might try the script auth_pam.pl. This script takes two two parameters -
the user name and the user password.

This perl script requires Authen::PAM.

The script has to be run as SUID. Therefore you should take some precautions
to not undermine your system's security. Change the group of the script to that
of your Web Server (for Apache this is normally nobody or apache) and don't
make it readable and executeable to anybody else, eg.:

chgrp nobody auth_pam.pl

The script has to be run SUID and has to be executed by sperl:

chmod 4750 auth_pam.pl

The first line (#!/usr/bin/sperl5.6.0) says where sperl is located on
your system. Please adapt this for your needs.

Now add the configuration to web/config.inc.php in your MRBS directory.
This looks as follows (adapt the path to auth_pam.pl according to your
your configuration):

$auth["realm"] = "MY REALM";

$auth["type"] = "ext";
$auth["prog"] = "/var/www/html/mrbs/auth_pam.pl";
$auth["params"] = "#USERNAME# #PASSWORD#";

That's it.

Note that this has been only tested with Red Hat 7.x. Feedback on whether this
works on other systems ( eg. Solaris) is appreciated.

Creating a new authentication scheme
====================================

Authentication programs are responsible for validating user/password pairs.
They must not attempt to communicate with the user.

Adding support for a new authentication service not yet supported by MRBS can
be done using one of the two following techniques:

Using a PHP module
------------------

You must create a new module called "auth_xxx.inc".

It will be configured by setting in config.inc.php:

$auth["type"] = "xxx";

The "auth_xxx.inc" file needs to define the following functions:

+-------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
|Function Name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Description &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Returns &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
+-------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
|authValidateUser($user, &nbsp;|Checks if the specified &nbsp; &nbsp; |0 = The pair is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
|$pass) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |username/password pair are &nbsp;|invalid or does not &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |valid. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|exist. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Non 0 = The pair is &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|valid &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
+-------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
|authGetUserLevel($user) &nbsp;|Determines the users access |0 = Unknown &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |level. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|1 = User &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|2 = Administrator &nbsp; &nbsp;|
+-------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+
Store any configuration parameters specific to your module in a dedicated
section in config.inc.php.

Finally update this document with a description of your module.

Using an external program
-------------------------

External authentication programs are invoked via the internal PHP configuration
proxy module called "auth_ext.inc".

The external program must take the username, password, and possibly other
values as parameters. Its exit code must be a zero for "OK", and anything else
for "not OK".

"auth_ext.inc" takes the following parameters in config.inc.php:

$auth["type"] = "ext";

$auth["prog"] = "the_pathname_of_your_program";
$auth["params"] = "the arguments your program needs";

"auth_ext.inc" constructs a command line to execute like:

$cmd = $auth["prog"] . ' ' . $auth["params"];

$cmd = preg_replace('/#USERNAME#/',$user,$cmd);
$cmd = preg_replace('/#PASSWORD#/',$pass,$cmd);

This should allow a lot of flexibility with different authenticators.

Creating a new session scheme
==============================

Session modules manage the user interface for obtaining the user name and
password. They also manage the way the name and password are recorded
throughout a session.

To create a new scheme, you must create a new PHP module called
"session_xxx.inc".

It will be configured by setting in config.inc.php:

$auth["session"] = "xxx";

The "session_xxx.inc" file needs to define certain functions:

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
|Function Name &nbsp; &nbsp;|Description &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Returns &nbsp; &nbsp; |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
|authGet() &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|Prompt the user for username/password. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |Nothing &nbsp; &nbsp; |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
|getUserName() &nbsp; &nbsp;|Returns the current user name. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |The user &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |name, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |or null if &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |not known. &nbsp;|
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
|getUserPassword()|Returns the current password. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|His &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |password, &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |or null if &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |not known. &nbsp;|
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
|PrintLogonBox() &nbsp;|Optional. If defined, it will be used to draw|Nothing &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |the contents of the logon/logoff box in MRBS | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |top banner. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+------------+
Note: Session schemes are also useful in the case where a web server enforces
its own session and authentication management. See the session_nt.inc and
session session_omni.inc files as examples. In this case, use in combination
with authentication "none", as the real authentication is already done during
the session initiation, and needs not be done again inside MRBS.

A little bit of history
=======================

The original version of MRBS, created by Daniel Gardner, did not have
username/password support. Each booking that was made had the IP address of the
client machine logged as the "creator" of the booking.

In this case the IP address functions as the "username".

This works well in the case where all IPs are static, and everyone is allowed
access to the system. In the wider world there are occasions where this is a
little too liberal.

To combat this MRBS 0.8 introduced authentication, initially provided by Sam
Mason <smason@mtc.ricardo.com>.

There are three levels of access in MRBS:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 0 - not logged in
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 1 - Authenticated
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Level 2 - Administrator

The administrators are allowed to modify other people's bookings, whereas Level
1 users can only change their own. Administrators also have the ability to add
and remove rooms and areas.

With time, several alternative authentication methods were introduced.
All rely on the same basic principles:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Each user is identified by a name.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Each name has a corresponding password.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The name/password pair must be valid in the authentication service
 &nbsp; &nbsp;MRBS connects to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- Some users have additional MRBS administration rights. Their names
 &nbsp; &nbsp;are listed in the $auth["admin"] list in config.inc.php.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- It's the web site creator's responsibility to manually enter the
 &nbsp; &nbsp;names of all the users that will have administrator rights in this list.

Before accessing a restricted page, MRBS prompts the user for a name and
password. Then it connects to an authentication server, which is responsible
for deciding if the user/password pair is valid. If it is, MRBS finally grants
access to the page.

The types of authentication servers supported are: LDAP servers; NT domain
controllers; Netware servers; POP3 email servers; IMAP email servers; etc.

Still the initial authentication system had shortcomings:

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- The user/password prompt relied on the HTTP basic authentication
 &nbsp; &nbsp;protocol, in a mode not supported by IIS web servers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- MRBS was increasingly used on the Internet, where central
 &nbsp; &nbsp;authentication servers are not available in the general case.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- There was no way to log off.

In MRBS 1.2, the authentication system was restructured by Jean-Franois
Larvoire <jf.larvoire@sf.net>

The main change was to separate the user/password acquisition (Also called
session initiation), from its validation (called authentication).

The existing routines for querying the user identity were moved to module
session_http.inc. This module is left in for backwards compatibility, but
deprecated. A new session management module was introduced, based on PHP's
built-in session management. This is the one recommended now on. It includes
the ability to log off.

On the authentication side, most existing modules were carried on, with the
session code removed. A simple module (auth_config.inc) was added, managing a
simple list of users in config.inc.php. Eventually there will also be another
authentication module, using a table of users in the MRBS database.
