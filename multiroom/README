Viewing a whole area in month or week view
==========================================

These are updated files that John and I have previously sent to the
mrbs-general mailing list.

There are four files:
functions.inc.txt
week_area.php.txt
week_area2.php.txt
month_area.php.txt

These files should be saved to your installation directory.
Save your current week.php and/or month.php to another name so that you
can put them back if you don't like these new versions.
Copy functions.inc.txt to functions.inc
Copy week_area.php.txt or week_area2.php.txt to week.php
 and/or
Copy month_area.php.txt to month.php

These files are compatible with version 1.2.1.
