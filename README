Meeting Room Booking System
http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/
-------------------------------

The Meeting Room Booking System (MRBS) is a PHP-based application for
booking meeting rooms (surprisingly!). I got annoyed with the piles of books
which were being used to book meetings. They were slow, hard to edit and only
at the reception desk. I thought that a nice web-based system would be much
nicer.

Some parts of this are based on WebCalender 0.9.4 by Craig Knudsen 
(http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/webcalendar/) but there is now very little
which is similar. There are fundamental design goal differences between
WebCalendar and MRBS - WC is for individuals, MRBS is for meeting rooms.

------
To Use
------
See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Once it's installed try going to http://yourhost/mrbs/

The first thing you'll need to do is login as an administrator and create
areas and rooms.

The default authentication scheme uses a database table in the MRBS
database. To create the first user click the "User list" link in the
top-right of the page. If there aren't any users defined in your database
yet, you will be able to create the first administrator.

Once you have logged in as an administrator you can click on "Rooms" and
create first an "Area", and then a "Room" within that area.

There are other ways to configure authentication in MRBS, see the
file AUTHENTICATION for a more complete description.

The latest version was tested with PHP 5.3.3, Apache 2.4, and either
MySQL 5.6+ or PostgreSQL 8.2+. It should work on just about anything
that's got PHP 5.3.3+ with MySQL 5.1+ or PostgreSQL 8.2+.

It should be pretty easy to adjust it to your corporate colours - you can
modify the themes under "Themes" or (preferably) copy an existing theme
to a new directory and modify the new theme.

See COPYING for licensing info.

See NEWS for a history of changes.

See AUTHENTICATION for information about user authentication/passwords.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------
- PHP 5.3.3+ with MySQL and/or PostgreSQL support
- MySQL or PostgreSQL

(If you are considering porting MRBS to another database, see README.sqlapi)

Warning:
- Some users reported errors using some accelerators (APC, PHP Accelerator).
  If you get messages like this : "Internal Zend error - Missing class
  information for ...", your accelerator is the cause.

------
Usage:
------
The current project maintainer reports using it at work with about 150 clients.
Many other reports of successful use have been seen on the MRBS mailing list,
and your report would be welcome there too. Let us know who is using MRBS!
