<H2>Getting MRBS</H2>
<P>
 The latest releases will always be available
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5113">here</A>
 with a small comment describing what's changed.

 However I tend to get a bit behind releasing files, so CVS is probably the
 best way to get stuff.  Instructions are
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=5113">here</A>.  The stuff 
 actually in CVS at the moment tends to be pretty stable, as I test it a bit
 before I put it on CVS.

 For installation instructions please refer to a file called "INSTALL" in the
 tarball that you download.
