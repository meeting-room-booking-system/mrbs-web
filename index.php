</p>
<h2>Stability</h2>
<p>
  MRBS is very reliable at this point. All the features 
  that are needed in day-to-day operation are included. It's very 
  intuitive for users, so very little or no instruction is needed. 
  It is in production use at many large organisations around the world 
  for uses as diverse as it's originally intended meeting rooms to 
  restaurant tables and aeroplanes at a flying school!
</p>
<p>
  Different languages are supported, there are translations 
  for many languages available (current list above).
  If your language is not supported it is very easy to customize as 
  all strings are stored in language-specific files.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  MRBS was originally written by Daniel Gardner. With the codebase initially 
  taken from <a href="http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/">WebCalendar</a> 
  because it seemed as though they had similar objectives. These days 
  there is very little (if any) code from the original project. There 
  have been many contributors to the project, most notably Sam Mason 
  and L J Bayak.
</p>
<p>
  Everything is provided by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> -
  because they're nice like that.
