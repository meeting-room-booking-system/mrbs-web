<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
 MRBS is a free, GPL, web application using PHP and mySQL for booking
 meeting rooms. The program supports multiple rooms grouping them by
 building.  The program automatically ensures that conflicting entrys
 cannot be entered, when making a booking you can choose to make the
 booking repeat at daily

 It would be easier to look at the <A HREF="demo.php">demo</A> it shows what the whole thing is about. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very reliable at this point. All the features that are needed in
 day-to-day operation are included. It's very intuitive for users, so very
 little or no instruction is needed.
</P>
<P>
 Different languages are supported, currently English and Japanese string files
 are included.

<H2>History</H2>
<P>
 MRBS was originally written by <A HREF="mailto:daniel@pl14759.demon.co.uk">
 Daniel Gardner</A>.  With the codebase initally taken from
 <A HREF="http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/">WebCalendar</A> because
 it seemed as though they had similar objectives.  These days there
 is very little code from the original project.
</P>
<P>
 Everything is provided by
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</A>- because they're nice like
 that.
