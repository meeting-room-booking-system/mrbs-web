<b>Version 1.0-pre2 (Sun Jul  8 13:43:53 BST 2001)</b>
    Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to configure a refresh
     time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable $refresh_rate to the
     number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.
    Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way it's phrased in
     the lang files, but the code works fine.  You can now a meeting that is
     repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.  This required a database
     change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and upgrade2.pg.sql
    Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required tokens.
     'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same line count.
     Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.
    Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a filter
     for LDAP authentication.
    Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with bookings made
     for times that have smaller granularity that the configured booking
     resolution.

    Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if
     HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like "sv, en".

    Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish language
     files from English file.  Swedish and Spanish users were not able
     to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the token being
     present.

    Checked in updates to lang.es (received from Pablo Gomez) and lang.de
    (received by Bernd Oeggl).

    Update lang.nl file (marc ter horst)

<b>Version 1.0-pre1 (Sun Mar  4 23:26:43 GMT 2001)</b>
    Internationalised functions.inc. "Help", "Admin" and "Search:" are now lang
    strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr, $lang["mrbs"] was defined twice.
    (jberanek)

    Added double quotes around all uses of color and class attributes, as HTML
    dictates. (jberanek)

    On conflict, show start time and link to day/week/month views (redinger)
    Link each search result start time to entry's day view (bernd, beranak)

    Branch Merge (2001-02-24 ljb):
    Incorporated all changes from branch mrbs-0-9-1xp into CVS trunk.
    Undoes post-branch change (0.9.2) to remove "weekstarts" function.
    Fix undefined variable warning $edit_type in edit_entry.php

<b>Version 0.9.2 (Fri Feb  9 20:09:42 GMT 2001)</b>
	Remove "weekstarts" functionality

<b>Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-13 daniel):</b>
    Added $I d$ tags to all files.

<b>Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-10 ljb):</b>
    For PHP4, rename *.php3 to *.php and changed all links.
    Major changes for database support for PostgreSQL:
        Original tables.sql renamed tables.my.sql for MySQL.
        Move sample data from tables.sql to sample-data.sql.
        New tables.pg.sql to build tables for PostgreSQL.
        New destroy.pg.sql to delete PostgreSQL tables and sequences.
        New grant.pg.sql - edit this and run to grant PostgreSQL rights.
        Replaced connect.inc with mysql.inc and pgsql.inc.
        New variable in config.inc "$dbsys" selects "mysql" or "pgsql".
        Renamed variables in config.inc to replace "mysql_" prefix with "db_".
        New wrapper funtions (see README.sqlapi) to encapsulate database calls.
        New pgsql.inc provides PostgreSQL implementation, and connects.
        New mysql.inc provides MySQL implementation, and connects.
        Rewrote all database calls to use wrapper functions.
        Rewrote all SQL statements to be standards-compliant, where possible.
            Used new wrapper routines where non-standard SQL is needed.
            Replace LEFT JOIN sequence with predicate-based joins.
        Changes to all error handling to ensure errors are properly reported.
    New week.php for Week View. (Experimental)
    New month.php for Month View. (Experimental)
    Added rows of links in trailer.inc to new month and week views.
    Changed Entry Type from 2 values (I=Internal, E=External) to 10 values.
        By default only the same 2 are defined in config.inc.
        Style sheet contains colors for 10 types.
        Selection box for type in edit/add entry form is dynamically built.
        Color key in day view dynamically built from defined types.
        Color key in day view moved to bottom of page.
    New Report function, linked from new button in the header. This makes
        a report on entries selected by date range and match strings.
    Add config.inc option db_nopersist to not use peristent DB connections.
    Add missing args to print_header call in del.php.
    Add config option eveningends_minutes to allow full 24 hour display with
        more resolution than 1 hour; also allows better control over the
        displayed hours, for example the last slot can now be 16:30-17:00.
    Removed unused functions from functions.inc: get_sunday_before()
        print_date_entries() display_unapproved_events() display_time()
        mysql_date_to_str() get_webrowser() hextoint() decode_str() encode_str()
        Also removed load_user_preferences code and calls to it.
    Remove redundant includes: functions.inc now assumes config.inc was
        included and does not include it again; search.php and view_entry.php do
        not need authentication so they don't need to include mrbs_auth.inc.
        Removed redundant connect to datbase in search.php.
    New error function fatal_error() to ensure errors are in a proper HTML page.
    Added new repeat type 5: Montly repeat, corresponding weekday and week.
    New authentication for Netware: auth_nw.inc (see README.nwauth). This is
        needed because nwauth takes the password on stdin, not cmdline.
    Used weblint to validate output pages and corrected HTML where needed.
        Quote all attribute values, fix bad attributes, balance tags.
    Moved HTML end tags into trailer.inc.
    Changed trailer to put " | " between dates, instead of ", " after each.
    In print_header, fix bad position of style.inc; must be in <HEAD> block.
    Fix syntax error when adding room if no capacity given (use 0).
    Change day.php to output equal-width room columns with centered headers.
    search.php: Use COUNT(*) and no ORDER BY when just getting match count.
    Fixed typo in view_entry.php on building up per-day repeat option string.
    Redesign loop for adding repeat dates to prevent it from scheduling 1 past
        the end date if the end date wasn't a date to schedule.
    Add "about" section to help.php to display viersion, system, database.
    Patch from BoK: fix "2 Decembers displayed if you pick "31 Nov" and Go.
        This makes sure the selected date is a valid date.
    Patch from robc: Fix to prevent edit entry to make it overlap another.
    New feature from Bo: Edit area and room names (new edit_area_room.php).
    Sort (order) the room names alphabetically in the main display (day.php).
    Changes found in CVS source:
    Changed "Booker's Name" to "Brief Description" (was in post-0.9pre1 CVS)
    View_entry uses multi-table query to show room description too (was in CVS)
    If no area is supplied, don't use 1 (or 0) since there might not be such
        an area (if it was deleted). Instead, use new get_default_area() which
        gets the lowest-numbered area.  In print_header(), don't pass along
        area as a hidden parameter if it wasn't supplied in the first place.
    Patch from BoK: Booking repeat Sat/Sun, only entered first Sun.
    Fixes to PHP magic quoting. We now turn of magic_quotes_runtime always,
        and use new slashes() and unslashes() to conditionaly deal with
        backslack-quotes depending on value of PHP's magic_quotes_gpc setting.
        NOTE: Possibly slightly incompatible change. Prior versions may have
        put pre-quoted values (area name, room name, booking name, booking
        description) into the database tables. This was wrong. If so, you
        will see funny \'s in the value displays.
        MRBS now should properly quote and unquote all values behind the scenes.
    Admin.php gets the area name from the database if it only has the ID.
    Patch from BoK: fix duplicate bookings from failure to delete caused by
        bad entry_type change to 2.
    Updates to site_faq.html - describe repeats, generalize Authentication info.
    Use a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) when adding an entry to prevent races.
    New maintenance SQL scripts: purge.my.sql and purge.pg.sql to delete old
        entries from your database (default 30 days old).
    Fixed field alignment in Add/Edit Entry form to right-justify labels.
    Security: Use EscapeShellCmd() on username and password in auth_ext.inc
    Fixed function toTimeString() to use lang[] for time units (I18N).
    Streamlined main query in day.php: omit unused columns, improve predicate
        to select by times from 6 compares to 2.
    In day.php, only fill in map entries during the day hours of interest.
    In lang.* language files, fixed quoting (found in CVS), comments, strip
        CRs and fixed some typos.
    Use double quotes around all string array indexes except inside strings.
        This avoids a PHP notice-level warning on each array reference.
    Fix undefined variable references to avoid notice-level PHP warnings.
    Bug fix: round meeting times up to $resolution units, not 30 minutes, and
        don't allow 0 minute meetings - make them 1 resolution unit instead.
    When using the footer to change dates, remember the current area.
    Changed view_entry to always show both time and date for start and end time;
        the CVS version was buggy and quirky in suppressing the date or time if
        it thought they were not important. Better to show too much info.
    New weekstarts and dateformat (Jan 01 vs 01 Jan) config (from BoK),
        generalized to show the week starting on any day.
    Add inline colors for non-CSS browsers (based on patch from John Beranek).
    Added current date header above day display (from John Beranek).
