-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<strong>Version 1.2-pre3</strong> (Fri May 14 04:00:00 GMT 2004):

[+] Added long awaited "periods" support. Calendar can displays 'periods'
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;instead of classic time of the day.
[+] New authentication scheme 'auth_db'. This is a web-based authentication,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;based on a user table in the mrbs database. User administration page has
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a special feature to automatically display fields that admin may add to
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the user table, no need to edit the code. This new authentication is not
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yet implemented for Postgresql.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PLEASE READ RELEVANT SECTION IN "AUTHENTICATION" BEFORE THE FIRST USE.
[+] Added email support. Emails can be sent to MRBS administrator, area or
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;room administrators, or bookers and for each entry creation, change or
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;deletion. Emails for changed entries display the value of previous
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;settings. Added emails fields to room/area admin and edit_users pages.
[+] Added option to retrieve users emails from other authentication
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;schemes as auth_db (if ldap is used, user email will be username plus
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;domain name)
[+] Added option to allow for a day to start at say 8:30 am.
[+] Database tables names are now variables defined in config.inc.php. This
      will allow users to install multiple sets of mrbs tables when only one
      SQL database is available, or resolve table name conflicts.
[+] Booking is now possible from the month view by clicking a new 'plus sign',
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;taking the user to an add entry page for that day of the month.
[+] Using auth_db, the link "you are XXXX" becomes a link to all upcoming
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;entries belonging to XXXX (report page).
[+] Added support for multiple pop3 or imap server to be used for
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;authentication (in case of failure).
[+] Added greek language (Stavros Papadakis), updated finish (Tom Ingberg),
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;german (Michael Glaessel) and swedish (MissterX) languages.
[+] Added option to determine the default starting view, i.e. month, week or
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;day (Warren Turkal) and the starting room.
[+] Added support for changing area/room in Add/Edit entry form.
[*] Capacity is not displayed in brackets next to room name if capacity is 0
[*] Preview page now displays the color key.
[*] Added option to display both time and descriptions in month view.
[*] Various enhancements to display/navigation (added pop-up messages in
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;various places, added direct links between room headings and week
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;view, highlighting of cells on mouse-over, highlighting of current
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;month/week/day in mini calendars, ability to book a room by clicking
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;anywhere in cells, navigation link duplicated under the calendar...)
[*] Added option to display time on right side in day and week view
[*] Enhancements to report page: added 'type', 'creator' and various sorting
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;options.
[*] LDAP servers login processes, does an anonymous bind first
[*] Fixed bug/enhancements to avoid url problems when using a proxy in
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the environment. Although breaking HTTP specs, use of relative paths
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;allows to run mrbs with https (ssl).
[*] Added some javascript code to control user inputs mainly in edit_entry.php
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(avoid selecting february 30,...)

and several other minor bug fixes and minor changes. To see details, please

MRBS can now be called  fulled Unicode. <br>      MRBS serves all of it's pages in UTF-8 and stores everything in the <br>      database in UTF-8. This means that all languages work together.<br>[+] Bubbles are displayed when mouse hover entries in day, week and month <br>      view, showing a more complete description.<br>[+] Allow to view weeks in the bottom of the web pages as week numbers <br>      instead of 'first day of the week' (Per Wermelin - SKIOLD S&aelig;by A/S&quot;<br>	  &lt;ela@skiold.dk&gt;).<br>[*] Added a new script for the &quot;ext&quot; authentication scheme that<br>	  allows you to use a password file with usernames and their<br>	  crypted passwords.<br>[-] Fixed bug #853410: When changing a non n-weekly entry, field &quot;Number of <br>      weeks (for n-weekly)&quot; appear...<br>[-] Fixed bug #846337: We can create rooms with no area<br>[-] Fixed bug #413175, #831310: Daylight savings time shift entries one hour <br>[-] Fixed bug: Always displays &quot;Edit Entry&quot; instead of &quot;Edit Series&quot; at top <br>      of page when editing a serie.<br>[-] Fixed bug in pop3 auth scheme.<br>[-] and several other minor bug fixes.<br>[*] Warning: MRBS does not work with postgreSQL 7.3 and above. <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.2-pre1</strong> (Tue Sep 23 06:00:00 GMT 2003):<br>
[*] Renamed config.inc to config.inc.php<br>[-] Fixed bug #748934, do not allow booking descriptions with only spaces.<br>[+] Added Windows NT / IIS authentication scheme.<br>[-] Fixed bug : Always displays &quot;edit entry&quot; instead of &quot;Add Entry&quot; even when<br>      adding an entry. (Ian Duncan)<br>[-] Fixed bug: repeated meetings selecting a &quot;Monthly repeat, same day of the<br>      week&quot; repeat type in the 5th week were not properly scheduled.<br>[-] Fixed bug: when you press on print preview<br>      in report.php page, all but the submission form is visible but<br>      not the actual report  (sQuare).<br>[*] In the minicalendar week view, the full week is highlighted instead of<br>      the first day of the week (sQuare).<br>[-] Bug fix: in week view, allow non 'internet explorer' browsers to see links<br>      to the corresponding days in column titles (Johan.Schonning).<br>[+] Entries in monthly view can be shown as start/end slot or brief description<br>[*] Replaced the column titles in the week view to  be links to the<br>      corresponding days (sQuare).<br>[-] Bug fix : italian vocab with character not properly escaped prevents<br>      deleting entries and/or prevent jcript popup to works (Pietro donatini)<br>[-] Fixed bug in escaping of username and password for all<br>      authentication schemes that use HTTP authentication.<br>[-] Fixed bug in bookings between 12:00 AM/PM and 12:59 AM/PM (AM/PM hour<br>    format)<br>[+] MRBS become compliant to the 'register_globals = off' directive<br>[-] Minor bug fixes<br>[+] Added translation: Finnish (Vesa Palmu), Portuguese (Lopo Pizarro),<br>    Danish (Claes Bolvig Pedersen).<br>[*] Minor translations updates an bug fixes<br>[-] Bug fix if drop-down select box is choosen to show areas/rooms<br>[*] Changed the tiny size of numbers in calendar to<br>      a larger one.<br>      <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.1</strong> (Tue Jan 14 10:00:00 GMT 2003)<br>
[+] Added configuration option ($twentyfourhour_format) to allow time<br>        formats to be changed to 12 hour format.<br>[*] Updated all language files to be consistant<br>[*] Changed minicals so they point to week when on week view and month on<br>        month view, rather than always pointing at day view<br>[*] Changed occurences of &quot;&lt;?=&quot; to &quot;&lt;?php echo&quot; which means we still<br>        use the long tag form everywhere.<br>[*] Removed all remainings english strings to make MRBS 100% translatable<br>        * Added new $vocab to del.php, edit_area_room.php, edit_entry.php,<br>          edit_entry_handler.php, help.php, mysql.inc, pgsql.inc, <br>          view_entry.php, functions.inc<br>[+] Modified config.inc language section to choose a site_faq.html file<br>        translated in another language.<br>        * Modified help.php to take these changes into account.<br>        * Added site_faq_fr.html (french)<br>[+] Added auth_name.inc, a auth_ip.inc variant using DNS name instead of ip.<br>[+] Added auth_omni.inc for use with OmniHTTPd web server security features<br>[-] Change search.php to remove warnings introduced with PHP 4.3.0<br>[-] Change trailer.inc to make print preview more likely to work on<br>        windows and non-apache servers<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.1-pre2</strong> (Thu Jan  9 17:50:00 GMT 2003)<br>
[+] New POP3 authentication scheme (Daniel Gardner)<br>[*] Updated Spanish translation<br>[-] Fix for edit entry page. We now determine the area id<br>        of the room the meeting we're editting is in before<br>        getting a list of the rooms in that area. This solves<br>        a number of errors that occur when editting/creating<br>        bookings.<br>[-] Fixes submitted/suggested by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Larvoire:<br>        * Added closing ?&gt; to index.php<br>        * Added &quot;global $refresh_rate;&quot; to style.inc<br>        * Fixed all occurences (hopefully) of $vocab[] indices<br>          written without surrounding quotes.<br>[*] Changed all uses of &lt;? to &lt;?php.<br>[+] Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search function,<br>        requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to<br>        each language file, &quot;search_button&quot; should be OK, as I took<br>        the text from each language's &quot;search&quot; token.<br>[-] Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the mailing list.<br>[*] Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a username<br>        as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for<br>        authentication.<br>[*] Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses<br>        escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP<br>        version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes escapeshellarg.inc<br>        which is a local implementation of that function.<br>[*] Added updated French translation, as provided by Thierry Wehr.<br>[*] Tided all language files again, they all have the same format<br>        and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2 translations<br>        because of the new advanced search functionality.<br>[-] Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation work.<br>        The code to include language files based on HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE<br>        has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.<br>        Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the<br>        abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any<br>        multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte<br>        of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now<br>        get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB<br>        locale).<br>[-] print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as<br>        sending Pragma no-cache and an Expires header in the<br>        past. This should help ensure the web pages don't get cached.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.1-pre1</strong> (Thu May 30 12:41:02 BST 2002)<br>
[*] add config option for drop-down boxes to select area and room<br>          (Thanks to sponsorship of LTC Corporation)<br>[+] allow multiple rooms to be booked at the same time<br>          (Thanks to sponsorship of the City of Wayne and LAEP)<br>[*] document need for register_globals() with new PHP versions<br>[+] add auth_nis.inc from Jeff Hoover (jberanek)<br>[+] add auth_imap.inc<br>[*] add warning about PHP3 not working<br>[*] new language tokens<br>[-] Stop problem where all strings turn to &quot;N&quot;<br>[-] Fixes a problem where $resolution is an odd amount<br>[*] extra javascript validation around n-weekly bookings<br>[-] extra array index quoting to stop newer php warnings<br>[*] Commented all authentication schemes (jberanek)<br>[*] Change mrbs_repeat schema for postgres (mrbs_repeat.rep_num_weeks =&gt; <br>        smallint)<br>[*] replace poxix_uname with php_uname function for portability<br>[-] Declare $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE global in config.inc<br>[-] some int casts to fix a bug from sourceforge<br>[*] language files normalised<br>[*] update translations: <br>        Norway, Rune Johansen<br>        France,<br>        Italy, Gianni<br>        Netherlands, Marc ter Horst<br>        Sweden, Hakan Nilsson<br>        Germany, Michael Redinger<br>[+] add translation:     Czech, SmEjDiL<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.0</strong> (Thu Aug 30 22:26:54 BST 2001)<br>
[+] Added two upgrade.xx.sql files which should have been in -pre2<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.0-pre2</strong> (Sun Jul  8 13:43:53 BST 2001)<br>
[*] Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to configure a refresh<br>        time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable $refresh_rate to the<br>        number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.<br>[+] Implemented &quot;n-weekly&quot; repeat type. Not sure I like the way it's phrased in<br>        the lang files, but the code works fine.  You can now have a meeting <br>        that is repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.  This required <br>        a database change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and <br>        upgrade2.pg.sql<br>[*] Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required tokens.<br>        'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same line count.<br>        Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.<br>[*] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a filter<br>        for LDAP authentication.<br>[-] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with bookings made<br>        for times that have smaller granularity that the configured booking<br>        resolution.<br>[-] Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if<br>        HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like &quot;sv, en&quot;.<br>[*] Copied &quot;rep_type_5&quot; language token into Swedish and Spanish language<br>        files from English file.  Swedish and Spanish users were not able<br>        to use &quot;monthly, corresponding day&quot; repeats without the token being<br>        present.<br>[*] Checked in updates to lang.es (received from Pablo Gomez) and lang.de<br>        (received by Bernd Oeggl).<br>[*] Update lang.nl file (marc ter horst)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 1.0-pre1</strong> (Sun Mar  4 23:26:43 GMT 2001)<br>
[*] Internationalised functions.inc. &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;Admin&quot; and &quot;Search:&quot; are now lang<br>        strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr, $vocab[&quot;mrbs&quot;] was defined <br>        twice. (jberanek)<br>[*] Added double quotes around all uses of color and class attributes, as HTML<br>        dictates. (jberanek)<br>[*] On conflict, show start time and link to day/week/month views (redinger)<br>[+] Link each search result start time to entry's day view (bernd, beranak)<br>    Branch Merge (2001-02-24 ljb):<br>[*] Incorporated all changes from branch mrbs-0-9-1xp into CVS trunk.<br>[*] Undoes post-branch change (0.9.2) to remove &quot;weekstarts&quot; function.<br>[-] Fix undefined variable warning $edit_type in edit_entry.php<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Version 0.9.2</strong> (Fri Feb  9 20:09:42 GMT 2001)<br>
[*] Remove &quot;weekstarts&quot; functionality<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp</strong> (2001-02-13 daniel):<br>
[*] Added $I d$ tags to all files.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp</strong> (2001-02-10 ljb):<br>
[*] For PHP4, rename *.php3 to *.php and changed all links.<br>[+] Major changes for database support for PostgreSQL:<br>        Original tables.sql renamed tables.my.sql for MySQL.<br>        Move sample data from tables.sql to sample-data.sql.<br>        New tables.pg.sql to build tables for PostgreSQL.<br>        New destroy.pg.sql to delete PostgreSQL tables and sequences.<br>        New grant.pg.sql - edit this and run to grant PostgreSQL rights.<br>        Replaced connect.inc with mysql.inc and pgsql.inc.<br>        New variable in config.inc &quot;$dbsys&quot; selects &quot;mysql&quot; or &quot;pgsql&quot;.<br>        Renamed variables in config.inc to replace &quot;mysql_&quot; prefix with &quot;db_&quot;.<br>        New wrapper funtions (see README.sqlapi) to encapsulate database calls.<br>        New pgsql.inc provides PostgreSQL implementation, and connects.<br>        New mysql.inc provides MySQL implementation, and connects.<br>        Rewrote all database calls to use wrapper functions.<br>        Rewrote all SQL statements to be standards-compliant, where possible.<br>            Used new wrapper routines where non-standard SQL is needed.<br>            Replace LEFT JOIN sequence with predicate-based joins.<br>        Changes to all error handling to ensure errors are properly reported.<br>[+] New week.php for Week View. (Experimental)<br>[+] New month.php for Month View. (Experimental)<br>[*] Added rows of links in trailer.inc to new month and week views.<br>[*] Changed Entry Type from 2 values (I=Internal, E=External) to 10 values.<br>        By default only the same 2 are defined in config.inc.<br>        Style sheet contains colors for 10 types.<br>        Selection box for type in edit/add entry form is dynamically built.<br>        Color key in day view dynamically built from defined types.<br>        Color key in day view moved to bottom of page.<br>[+] New Report function, linked from new button in the header. This makes<br>        a report on entries selected by date range and match strings.<br>[*] Add config.inc option db_nopersist to not use persistent DB connections.<br>[-] Add missing args to print_header call in del.php.<br>[+] Add config option eveningends_minutes to allow full 24 hour display with<br>        more resolution than 1 hour; also allows better control over the<br>        displayed hours, for example the last slot can now be 16:30-17:00.<br>[*] Removed unused functions from functions.inc: get_sunday_before()<br>        print_date_entries() display_unapproved_events() display_time()<br>        mysql_date_to_str() get_webrowser() hextoint() decode_str() encode_str()<br>        Also removed load_user_preferences code and calls to it.<br>[*] Remove redundant includes: functions.inc now assumes config.inc was<br>        included and does not include it again; search.php and view_entry.php do<br>        not need authentication so they don't need to include mrbs_auth.inc.<br>        Removed redundant connect to datbase in search.php.<br>[*] New error function fatal_error() to ensure errors are in a proper HTML page.<br>[+] Added new repeat type 5: Montly repeat, corresponding weekday and week.<br>[+] New authentication for Netware: auth_nw.inc (see README.nwauth). This is<br>        needed because nwauth takes the password on stdin, not cmdline.<br>[*] Used weblint to validate output pages and corrected HTML where needed.<br>        Quote all attribute values, fix bad attributes, balance tags.<br>[*] Moved HTML end tags into trailer.inc.<br>[*] Changed trailer to put &quot; | &quot; between dates, instead of &quot;, &quot; after each.<br>[-] In print_header, fix bad position of style.inc; must be in &lt;HEAD&gt; block.<br>[-] Fix syntax error when adding room if no capacity given (use 0).<br>[*] Change day.php to output equal-width room columns with centered headers.<br>[*] search.php: Use COUNT(*) and no ORDER BY when just getting match count.<br>[*] Fixed typo in view_entry.php on building up per-day repeat option string.<br>[-] Redesign loop for adding repeat dates to prevent it from scheduling 1 past<br>        the end date if the end date wasn't a date to schedule.<br>[*] Add &quot;about&quot; section to help.php to display viersion, system, database.<br>[-] Patch from BoK: fix &quot;2 Decembers displayed if you pick &quot;31 Nov&quot; and Go.<br>        This makes sure the selected date is a valid date.<br>[-] Patch from robc: Fix to prevent edit entry to make it overlap another.<br>[+] New feature from Bo: Edit area and room names (new edit_area_room.php).<br>[*] Sort (order) the room names alphabetically in the main display (day.php).<br>    Changes found in CVS source:<br>[*] Changed &quot;Booker's Name&quot; to &quot;Brief Description&quot; (was in post-0.9pre1 CVS)<br>[*] View_entry uses multi-table query to show room description too (was in CVS)<br>[*] If no area is supplied, don't use 1 (or 0) since there might not be such<br>        an area (if it was deleted). Instead, use new get_default_area() which<br>        gets the lowest-numbered area.  In print_header(), don't pass along<br>        area as a hidden parameter if it wasn't supplied in the first place.<br>[*] Patch from BoK: Booking repeat Sat/Sun, only entered first Sun.<br>[*] Fixes to PHP magic quoting. We now turn of magic_quotes_runtime always,<br>        and use new slashes() and unslashes() to conditionaly deal with<br>        backslack-quotes depending on value of PHP's magic_quotes_gpc setting.<br>        NOTE: Possibly slightly incompatible change.
