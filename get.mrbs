Getting MRBS
Download
The best way to get the source is to use CVS - see the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=5113>CVS page</a> at sourceforge. CVS is really easy - if you haven't tried it yet then start now! If you really are that scared of CVS or don't have it yet for some reason then you can get a tarball. Check <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=5113>the released files</a> for the latest stable version.

Install
There's a file called INSTALL in the distribution. Surprisingly enough it will tell you how to install MRBS.
