[============================]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.4 (Wed Apr 21 17:00:00 BST 2010):

[*] Finnish translation update, provided by Tuomas.
[-] Fixed test for E_DEPRECATED, which was causing warnings on
 some versions of PHP.
[+] Added the ability to repeat the headers at the bottom of the
 table on day and week views - see the configuration variable
 $column_labels_both_ends.
[+] Added ability to set a password strength policy for the 'db'
 authentication scheme.
[-] Added a missing include line, the absence of which was causing
 errors when $default_room was non-zero.

 that need to be authorised before they enter the calendar.
[-] Fixed a problem with the display of the All Day checkbox in the
 edit_entry form in IE8.

 can make bookings.
[*] Added  the name of the deleting user to email notifications of
  deleted entries.
[-] Fixed incorrect reporting of durations in email notifications.

 unless the start period was the first period of the day. 
[-] Fixed bug which caused the duration to be blank in email
 notifications for bookings when "All day" was checked.
[-]  Partially fixed a problem to do with the handling of All Day

 calculated properly when more than one repeat day was checked.
[-] Removed text after closing tag in Polish translation file,
 as reported in SF #2970638.

[+] Added the ability to add custom fields for rooms, the custom
 fields must be added by the administrator in their favourite SQL
 admin tool.
[*] The "edit users" screen now handles textareas and checkboxes for
 custom fields, just like the room custom field handling does.
[+] Added a "custom_html" field for areas and rooms - this allows
 custom HTML to be attached to areas and rooms.
[*] Added check to see if the configuration variable $timezone is set -
 it's too important to count as a non-fatal configuration error.
[*] Improved the layout of email configuration settings in
 systemdefaults.inc.php to make them more clear.
[*] Added transaction support to MySQL DB abstractions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.3 (Tue Nov 24 22:00:00 GMT 2009):

[+] Moved default configuration values out of config.inc.php - this file
 should now only contain settings the administrator has changed (plus
 a few unfortunately necessary bits of internal code).
[-] Improved error reporting in the DB upgrade mechanism.

[+] Added a configuration variable for setting a login link for the
 'remote_user' authentication scheme.
[*] Fix for setting UTF-8 locale on BSD, as provided in SF tracker #2859067.

 to retype the form after an error.

 a day that the repeat is not scheduled for.

 not exist in the month MRBS will use the last day of the month.
[+] Added code to disable E_DEPRECATED error class for PHP >= 5.3.
[-]  Fixed LDAP auth method so that $ldap_filter will work if you use

 client charset if $unicode_encoding is true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4.2 (Thu July 15 00:00 BST 2009): 

[+] Added checking of lengths of values for user-typeable fields, so that
 overly long field values aren't passed to the MRBS database, - something
 which causes errors with PostgreSQL. Adds new array variable $maxlength
 to config.inc.php that _must_ be populated if you are upgrading and keeping
 your old config.inc.php.
[+] Added automatic upgrade system for upgrading MRBS installations
 as the database schema changes. When an upgrade is needed MRBS will
 prompt for database admin user authentication details.
[+] Sites can also define their own local DB schema changes, using the
 sane upgrade system.
[*] Made access levels more flexible, by adding definitions for
 "maximum level" and "minimum editing level" into config.inc.php.
[*] Moved database table creation/alteration code out of edit_users.php,
 it is now done with the upgrade system.

 to the booker and administrators. Feature provided by Cory Jaeger and later
 enhanced to allow private booking functionality to be configurable
 per area.
[*] Added check for PHP LDAP support into auth_ldap.inc, based on a suggestion
 from Chris Cook.
[-] Fixed issue with booknig display if booking "clipping" is turned off.
[-] Added some missing SQL escaping in various places in response to
 Secunia Advisory SA35469.
[*] Booking fields that have maximum lengths in the database are now
 truncated before adding them to the database, and additionally HTML
 form elements have 'maxlength' attributes to match the database column
 widths.

[*] Checks are now done to ensure that area names are unique and room names
 are unique within an area.
[*] Improved room deletion, so that repeat entries for the room are deleted.
[*] You can now move a room between areas.

 booking.
[*] Made theme functionality more flexible, by allowing a theme to
 change the page header.

 view so that the columns are rows and vice versa.
[-] Fix for NIS authentication on systems that use crypt methods other

 column in the mrbs_repeat table is the correct width.
[-] Fixed syntax error in auth_db_ext.inc reported on the mailing list.

[*] Improved print view, including changes that ensure cell
 boundaries are visible.

 format before an SQL call, thereby creating an error. First report of
 the problem was  SF tracker #1794351.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Fixed line endings in a number of files, caused by Subversion
 misconfiguration.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4 (Wed Dec  3 15:00:00 GMT 2008):

[+] Added Hungarian internationalision, in preparation for an offered
 translation.
[-] Removed all HTML entities apart from &nbsp; from the translations,
 so that the flawed PHP function html_entity_decode() doesn't need
 to be used in the email sending code - solving a problem when running
 MRBS with PHP 4.
[*] Booking highlighting is now performed with CSS rather than JavaScript
 by default, except in IE6, which doesn't support the appropriate
 CSS feature. This improves performance in IE7/8, and makes the highlighting
 not depend on JavaScript, which is good.

 came from, be in day, week or month.

[+] New authentication scheme 'auth_db'. This is a web-based authentication,
      based on a user table in the mrbs database. User administration page has
      a special feature to automatically display fields that admin may add to
      the user table, no need to edit the code. This new authentication is not
      yet implemented for Postgresql.
      PLEASE READ RELEVANT SECTION IN "AUTHENTICATION" BEFORE THE FIRST USE.
[+] Added email support. Emails can be sent to MRBS administrator, area or
      room administrators, or bookers and for each entry creation, change or
      deletion. Emails for changed entries display the value of previous
      settings. Added emails fields to room/area admin and edit_users pages.

[+] Database tables names are now variables defined in config.inc.php. This
will allow users to install multiple sets of mrbs tables when only one
SQL database is available, or resolve table name conflicts.
[+] Booking is now possible from the month view by clicking a new 'plus sign',
      taking the user to an add entry page for that day of the month.
[+] Using auth_db, the link "you are XXXX" becomes a link to all upcoming
      entries belonging to XXXX (report page).
[+] Added support for multiple pop3 or imap server to be used for
      authentication (in case of failure).
[+] Added greek language (Stavros Papadakis), updated finish (Tom Ingberg),

[*] Capacity is not displayed in brackets next to room name if capacity is 0
[*] Preview page now displays the color key.
[*] Added option to display both time and descriptions in month view.

      various places, added direct links between room headings and week
      view, highlighting of cells on mouse-over, highlighting of current
      month/week/day in mini calendars, ability to book a room by clicking
      anywhere in cells, navigation link duplicated under the calendar...)
[*] Added option to display time on right side in day and week view
[*] Enhancements to report page: added 'type', 'creator' and various sorting
      options.
[*] LDAP servers login processes, does an anonymous bind first

      the environment. Although breaking HTTP specs, use of relative paths
      allows to run mrbs with https (ssl).

      (avoid selecting february 30,...)

and several other minor bug fixes and minor changes. To see details, please
read /web/Changelog file from Dec 07 2003.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2-pre2 (Sun Dec 07 00:00:00 GMT 2003):

[+] Completely revamped authentication logic.
    Now MRBS make use of sessions to store temporary user informations,
    ability to log on/off, and so on.. This is now the default mode.
    See AUTHENTICATION for more details.
[+] Revamped localisation.
      Automatic language determination made much better, works for
	  Windows and Unix servers now
[+] Added utility to convert text in the database to UTF8.
[+] Revamped internationalisation. MRBS can now be called  fulled Unicode. 
      MRBS serves all of it's pages in UTF-8 and stores everything in the 
      database in UTF-8. This means that all languages work together.
[+] Bubbles are displayed when mouse hover entries in day, week and month 
      view, showing a more complete description.
[+] Allow to view weeks in the bottom of the web pages as week numbers 
      instead of 'first day of the week' (Per Wermelin - SKIOLD Sæby A/S"
	  <ela@skiold.dk>).
[*] Added a new script for the "ext" authentication scheme that
	  allows you to use a password file with usernames and their
	  crypted passwords.

      weeks (for n-weekly)" appear...

      week" repeat type in the 5th week were not properly scheduled.
[-] Fixed bug: when you press on print preview
      in report.php page, all but the submission form is visible but
      not the actual report  (sQuare).
[*] In the minicalendar week view, the full week is highlighted instead of
      the first day of the week (sQuare).
[-] Bug fix: in week view, allow non 'internet explorer' browsers to see links
      to the corresponding days in column titles (Johan.Schonning).
[+] Entries in monthly view can be shown as start/end slot or brief description
[*] Replaced the column titles in the week view to  be links to the
	  corresponding days (sQuare).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1 (Tue Jan 14 10:00:00 GMT 2003)

[+] Added configuration option ($twentyfourhour_format) to allow time
        formats to be changed to 12 hour format.
[*] Updated all language files to be consistant
[*] Changed minicals so they point to week when on week view and month on
        month view, rather than always pointing at day view
[*] Changed occurences of "<?=" to "<?php echo" which means we still
        use the long tag form everywhere.
[*] Removed all remainings english strings to make MRBS 100% translatable
        * Added new $vocab to del.php, edit_area_room.php, edit_entry.php,
          edit_entry_handler.php, help.php, mysql.inc, pgsql.inc, 
          view_entry.php, functions.inc
[+] Modified config.inc language section to choose a site_faq.html file
        translated in another language.
        * Modified help.php to take these changes into account.
        * Added site_faq_fr.html (french)
[+] Added auth_name.inc, a auth_ip.inc variant using DNS name instead of ip.
[+] Added auth_omni.inc for use with OmniHTTPd web server security features
[-] Change search.php to remove warnings introduced with PHP 4.3.0
[-] Change trailer.inc to make print preview more likely to work on
        windows and non-apache servers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1-pre2 (Thu Jan  9 17:50:00 GMT 2003)

[+] New POP3 authentication scheme (Daniel Gardner)
[*] Updated Spanish translation
[-] Fix for edit entry page. We now determine the area id
        of the room the meeting we're editting is in before
        getting a list of the rooms in that area. This solves
        a number of errors that occur when editting/creating
        bookings.
[-] Fixes submitted/suggested by Jean-François Larvoire:
        * Added closing ?> to index.php
        * Added "global $refresh_rate;" to style.inc
        * Fixed all occurences (hopefully) of $vocab[] indices
          written without surrounding quotes.
[*] Changed all uses of <? to <?php.
[+] Merged change from John Beranek for an Advanced search function,
        requires 3 more translation tokens, which have been added to
        each language file, "search_button" should be OK, as I took
        the text from each language's "search" token.
[-] Fixed 2 problems in edit_entry.php as submitted on the mailing list.
[*] Added small enchancement to smb_auth.c, if you pass a username
        as group/user, it will change the NT group that is used for
        authentication.
[*] Improved shell escaping in auth_ext.inc. It now uses
        escapeshellarg() instead of escapeshellcmd(). If your PHP
        version is less than 4.0.3, then it includes escapeshellarg.inc
        which is a local implementation of that function.
[*] Added updated French translation, as provided by Thierry Wehr.
[*] Tided all language files again, they all have the same format
        and number of lines now, and are all missing at least 2 translations
        because of the new advanced search functionality.
[-] Fixed a number of bugs to make the Taiwanese translation work.
        The code to include language files based on HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
        has been improved, which ensures lang.zh-tw is included.
        Additionally, mincals.inc not longer does a substr() on the
        abbreviated weekday names, as this breaks terribly for any
        multibyte encoding, as it was only taking the first byte
        of a multibyte encoding. This has the impact that you now
        get Mon,Tue,Wed etc instead of M,T,W (using glibc's en_GB
        locale).
[-] print_header() now outputs a DOCTYPE identifier as well as
        sending Pragma no-cache and an Expires header in the
        past. This should help ensure the web pages don't get cached.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1-pre1 (Thu May 30 12:41:02 BST 2002)

[*] add config option for drop-down boxes to select area and room
          (Thanks to sponsorship of LTC Corporation)
[+] allow multiple rooms to be booked at the same time
          (Thanks to sponsorship of the City of Wayne and LAEP)
[*] document need for register_globals() with new PHP versions
[+] add auth_nis.inc from Jeff Hoover (jberanek)
[+] add auth_imap.inc
[*] add warning about PHP3 not working
[*] new language tokens
[-] Stop problem where all strings turn to "N"
[-] Fixes a problem where $resolution is an odd amount
[*] extra javascript validation around n-weekly bookings
[-] extra array index quoting to stop newer php warnings
[*] Commented all authentication schemes (jberanek)
[*] Change mrbs_repeat schema for postgres (mrbs_repeat.rep_num_weeks => 
        smallint)
[*] replace poxix_uname with php_uname function for portability
[-] Declare $HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE global in config.inc
[-] some int casts to fix a bug from sourceforge
[*] language files normalised
[*] update translations: 
        Norway, Rune Johansen
        France,
        Italy, Gianni
        Netherlands, Marc ter Horst
        Sweden, Hakan Nilsson
        Germany, Michael Redinger
[+] add translation:     Czech, SmEjDiL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 (Thu Aug 30 22:26:54 BST 2001)

[+] Added two upgrade.xx.sql files which should have been in -pre2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre2 (Sun Jul  8 13:43:53 BST 2001)

[*] Incorporated diff from Scott Leonard that allows you to configure a refresh
        time for roombooker web pages.  Set config variable $refresh_rate to the
        number of seconds to refresh after, or set to 0 to disable.
[+] Implemented "n-weekly" repeat type. Not sure I like the way it's phrased in
        the lang files, but the code works fine.  You can now have a meeting 
        that is repeated every 'n' weeks. e.g. every 5th Monday.  This required 
        a database change, which I've made available in upgrade2.my.sql and 
        upgrade2.pg.sql
[*] Tidied lang files, and ensured every file has all the required tokens.
        'wc -l lang.*' now shows all the files as having the same line count.
        Quite a few languages now have English bits in them though.
[*] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that allow you to configure a filter
        for LDAP authentication.
[-] Incorporated diffs from Tim Bell that solve problems with bookings made
        for times that have smaller granularity that the configured booking
        resolution.
[-] Fixed config.inc so that the correct lang.xx is included if
        HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is a comma-seperated list like "sv, en".
[*] Copied "rep_type_5" language token into Swedish and Spanish language
        files from English file.  Swedish and Spanish users were not able
        to use "monthly, corresponding day" repeats without the token being
        present.
[*] Checked in updates to lang.es (received from Pablo Gomez) and lang.de
        (received by Bernd Oeggl).
[*] Update lang.nl file (marc ter horst)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0-pre1 (Sun Mar  4 23:26:43 GMT 2001)

[*] Internationalised functions.inc. "Help", "Admin" and "Search:" are now lang
        strings. Also, fixed an error in lang.fr, $vocab["mrbs"] was defined 
        twice. (jberanek)
[*] Added double quotes around all uses of color and class attributes, as HTML
        dictates. (jberanek)
[*] On conflict, show start time and link to day/week/month views (redinger)
[+] Link each search result start time to entry's day view (bernd, beranak)

    Branch Merge (2001-02-24 ljb):
[*] Incorporated all changes from branch mrbs-0-9-1xp into CVS trunk.
[*] Undoes post-branch change (0.9.2) to remove "weekstarts" function.
[-] Fix undefined variable warning $edit_type in edit_entry.php

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9.2 (Fri Feb  9 20:09:42 GMT 2001)

[*] Remove "weekstarts" functionality

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-13 daniel):

[*] Added $I d$ tags to all files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch mrbs-0-9-1xp (2001-02-10 ljb):

[*] For PHP4, rename *.php3 to *.php and changed all links.
[+] Major changes for database support for PostgreSQL:
        Original tables.sql renamed tables.my.sql for MySQL.
        Move sample data from tables.sql to sample-data.sql.
        New tables.pg.sql to build tables for PostgreSQL.
        New destroy.pg.sql to delete PostgreSQL tables and sequences.
        New grant.pg.sql - edit this and run to grant PostgreSQL rights.
        Replaced connect.inc with mysql.inc and pgsql.inc.
        New variable in config.inc "$dbsys" selects "mysql" or "pgsql".
        Renamed variables in config.inc to replace "mysql_" prefix with "db_".
        New wrapper funtions (see README.sqlapi) to encapsulate database calls.
        New pgsql.inc provides PostgreSQL implementation, and connects.
        New mysql.inc provides MySQL implementation, and connects.
        Rewrote all database calls to use wrapper functions.
        Rewrote all SQL statements to be standards-compliant, where possible.
            Used new wrapper routines where non-standard SQL is needed.
            Replace LEFT JOIN sequence with predicate-based joins.
        Changes to all error handling to ensure errors are properly reported.
[+] New week.php for Week View. (Experimental)
[+] New month.php for Month View. (Experimental)
[*] Added rows of links in trailer.inc to new month and week views.
[*] Changed Entry Type from 2 values (I=Internal, E=External) to 10 values.
        By default only the same 2 are defined in config.inc.
        Style sheet contains colors for 10 types.
        Selection box for type in edit/add entry form is dynamically built.
        Color key in day view dynamically built from defined types.
        Color key in day view moved to bottom of page.
[+] New Report function, linked from new button in the header. This makes
        a report on entries selected by date range and match strings.
[*] Add config.inc option db_nopersist to not use persistent DB connections.
[-] Add missing args to print_header call in del.php.
[+] Add config option eveningends_minutes to allow full 24 hour display with
        more resolution than 1 hour; also allows better control over the
        displayed hours, for example the last slot can now be 16:30-17:00.
[*] Removed unused functions from functions.inc: get_sunday_before()
        print_date_entries() display_unapproved_events() display_time()
        mysql_date_to_str() get_webrowser() hextoint() decode_str() encode_str()
        Also removed load_user_preferences code and calls to it.
[*] Remove redundant includes: functions.inc now assumes config.inc was
        included and does not include it again; search.php and view_entry.php do
        not need authentication so they don't need to include mrbs_auth.inc.
        Removed redundant connect to datbase in search.php.
[*] New error function fatal_error() to ensure errors are in a proper HTML page.
[+] Added new repeat type 5: Montly repeat, corresponding weekday and week.
[+] New authentication for Netware: auth_nw.inc (see README.nwauth). This is
        needed because nwauth takes the password on stdin, not cmdline.
[*] Used weblint to validate output pages and corrected HTML where needed.
        Quote all attribute values, fix bad attributes, balance tags.
[*] Moved HTML end tags into trailer.inc.
[*] Changed trailer to put " | " between dates, instead of ", " after each.
[-] In print_header, fix bad position of style.inc; must be in <HEAD> block.
[-] Fix syntax error when adding room if no capacity given (use 0).
[*] Change day.php to output equal-width room columns with centered headers.
[*] search.php: Use COUNT(*) and no ORDER BY when just getting match count.
[*] Fixed typo in view_entry.php on building up per-day repeat option string.
[-] Redesign loop for adding repeat dates to prevent it from scheduling 1 past
        the end date if the end date wasn't a date to schedule.
[*] Add "about" section to help.php to display viersion, system, database.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix "2 Decembers displayed if you pick "31 Nov" and Go.
        This makes sure the selected date is a valid date.
[-] Patch from robc: Fix to prevent edit entry to make it overlap another.
[+] New feature from Bo: Edit area and room names (new edit_area_room.php).
[*] Sort (order) the room names alphabetically in the main display (day.php).
    Changes found in CVS source:
[*] Changed "Booker's Name" to "Brief Description" (was in post-0.9pre1 CVS)
[*] View_entry uses multi-table query to show room description too (was in CVS)
[*] If no area is supplied, don't use 1 (or 0) since there might not be such
        an area (if it was deleted). Instead, use new get_default_area() which
        gets the lowest-numbered area.  In print_header(), don't pass along
        area as a hidden parameter if it wasn't supplied in the first place.
[*] Patch from BoK: Booking repeat Sat/Sun, only entered first Sun.
[*] Fixes to PHP magic quoting. We now turn of magic_quotes_runtime always,
        and use new slashes() and unslashes() to conditionaly deal with
        backslack-quotes depending on value of PHP's magic_quotes_gpc setting.
        NOTE: Possibly slightly incompatible change. Prior versions may have
        put pre-quoted values (area name, room name, booking name, booking
        description) into the database tables. This was wrong. If so, you
        will see funny \'s in the value displays.
        MRBS now should properly quote and unquote all values behind the scenes.
[*] Admin.php gets the area name from the database if it only has the ID.
[-] Patch from BoK: fix duplicate bookings from failure to delete caused by
        bad entry_type change to 2.
[*] Updates to site_faq.html - describe repeats, generalize Authentication info.
[*] Use a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) when adding an entry to prevent races.
[+] New maintenance SQL scripts: purge.my.sql and purge.pg.sql to delete old
        entries from your database (default 30 days old).
[*] Fixed field alignment in Add/Edit Entry form to right-justify labels.
[*] Security: Use EscapeShellCmd() on username and password in auth_ext.inc
[-] Fixed function toTimeString() to use lang[] for time units (I18N).
[*] Streamlined main query in day.php: omit unused columns, improve predicate
        to select by times from 6 compares to 2.
[*] In day.php, only fill in map entries during the day hours of interest.
[*] In lang.* language files, fixed quoting (found in CVS), comments, strip
        CRs and fixed some typos.
[-] Use double quotes around all string array indexes except inside strings.
        This avoids a PHP notice-level warning on each array reference.
[-] Fix undefined variable references to avoid notice-level PHP warnings.
[-] Bug fix: round meeting times up to $resolution units, not 30 minutes, and
        don't allow 0 minute meetings - make them 1 resolution unit instead.
[*] When using the footer to change dates, remember the current area.
[-] Changed view_entry to always show both time and date for start and end time;
        the CVS version was buggy and quirky in suppressing the date or time if
        it thought they were not important. Better to show too much info.
[+] New weekstarts and dateformat (Jan 01 vs 01 Jan) config (from BoK),
        generalized to show the week starting on any day.
[*] Add inline colors for non-CSS browsers (based on patch from John Beranek).
[*] Added current date header above day display (from John Beranek).
